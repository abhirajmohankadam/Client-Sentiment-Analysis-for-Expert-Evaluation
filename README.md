<h1>Client Sentiment Analysis For Expert Evaluation</h1>
    <p>This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing transcripts from voice, chat, and email interactions, the project seeks to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into customer opinions about different companies.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Classification:</strong> Classify customer sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral using machine learning models.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Create visual representations of sentiment analysis results to effectively communicate findings.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Insights Extraction:</strong> Identify trends and patterns in customer sentiments across various companies.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python:</strong> The primary programming language for data processing and model implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>NLTK:</strong> Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and sentiment analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>SpaCy:</strong> For advanced NLP tasks such as named entity recognition and dependency parsing.</li>
        <li><strong>Pandas:</strong> For data manipulation and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Matplotlib:</strong> For creating visualizations of the analysis results.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Gather voice transcripts, chat logs, and email feedback from customers across different companies.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean and preprocess the textual data using NLTK and SpaCy for tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement various classification models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN) to determine sentiment polarity with an expected accuracy of around 79%.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct EDA to uncover key insights such as frequently mentioned topics and sentiment trends over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Visualization:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilize Matplotlib to create charts and graphs that represent sentiment distributions and comparisons across companies.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reporting:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate comprehensive reports summarizing the findings and actionable recommendations for improving customer satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic knowledge of Python programming.</li>
        <li>Familiarity with machine learning concepts is beneficial but not mandatory.</li>
    </ul>
